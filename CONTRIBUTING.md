## üöÄ Development Setup

### Prerequisites
```bash

ffmpeg.exe
yt-dlp.exe
```

### Quick Start
```bash
# 1. Fork and clone
git clone https://github.com/your-username/clippilot.git
cd clippilot

# 2. Install dependencies
npm ci

# 3. Setup tools (optional for development)
# Download ffmpeg.exe to tools/ffmpeg/
# Download yt-dlp.exe to tools/yt-dlp/

# 4. Start development
npm run dev
```

### Environment Setup
```bash
# Copy environment template
cp .env.example .env

# Add your YouTube API key (optional)
# YOUTUBE_API_KEY=your_key_here
```

## üìù Coding Standards

### TypeScript
- Use strict TypeScript configuration
- Add type annotations for public APIs
- Prefer interfaces over types for objects
- Use Zod for runtime validation

```typescript
// ‚úÖ Good
interface VideoInfo {
  id: string
  title: string
  duration: number
}

// ‚úÖ Good - with validation
const VideoSchema = z.object({
  id: z.string(),
  title: z.string(),
  duration: z.number()
})
```

### React Components
- Use functional components with hooks
- Keep components focused and small
- Use proper TypeScript props typing
- Follow React best practices

```tsx
// ‚úÖ Good component structure
interface SearchBarProps {
  onSearch: (query: string) => void
  placeholder?: string
}

export default function SearchBar({ onSearch, placeholder }: SearchBarProps) {
  // Component implementation
}
```

### Styling
- Use Tailwind CSS for styling
- Follow responsive design principles
- Maintain consistent spacing and colors
- Use semantic HTML elements

```tsx
// ‚úÖ Good styling
<button className="px-4 py-2 bg-blue-500 text-white rounded-md hover:bg-blue-600 transition-colors">
  Download
</button>
```

### Electron Best Practices
- Keep main process minimal
- Use secure IPC patterns
- Validate all renderer inputs
- Follow Electron security guidelines

## üß™ Testing

### Running Tests
```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run specific test file
npm test SearchBar.test.tsx

# Run tests in watch mode
npm test -- --watch
```

### Test Coverage
- Add tests for new features
- Maintain existing test coverage
- Test both happy path and error cases
- Include integration tests for critical features

### Manual Testing
```bash
# Test development build
npm run dev

# Test production build
npm run dist
# Test the generated installer
```

## üì¶ Release Process

### Version Management
```bash
# Bump version (automatically updates package.json and version.ts)
npm run version:patch  # Bug fixes
npm run version:minor  # New features
npm run version:major  # Breaking changes
```

### Pre-release Checklist

4. **Create tag**: `git tag v1.x.x`
5. **Push changes**: `git push && git push --tags`
6. **Create GitHub release** with built artifacts

## üåç Internationalization

### Adding New Languages

```json
// Example translation file structure
{
  "search_placeholder": "Search for videos...",
  "download": "Download",
  "settings": "Settings"
}
```
